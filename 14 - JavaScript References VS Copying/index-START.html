    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const playerscopy = players.map(player => player)
    playerscopy[0] = 'AAA';
    console.log(playerscopy);
    console.log(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let p2 = person;

    // person = "XXX";
    // console.log(person,p2); //XXX,{...}

    // person.name ="XXX";
    // console.log(person,p2); //{XXX...},(XXX...)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // 利用Object.assign複製物件
    let p3 = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(p3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
